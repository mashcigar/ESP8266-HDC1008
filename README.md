# ESP8266-HDC1008
Arduino IDE code for using Adafruit's Huzzah Feather ESP8266 with HDC1008 and Adafruit IO

Feather : https://www.adafruit.com/products/2821
HDC1008 : https://www.adafruit.com/products/2635

The original code was modified to work with an Adafruit HDC1008 breakout board instead of a DHT11 or DHT22.  
It was also modified to pull the voltage for uses with a Lipo battery.

I set up 3 feeds in Adafruit IO - Temperature, Humidity and Voltage.
