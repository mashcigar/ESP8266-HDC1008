# ESP8266-HDC1008
Arduino IDE code for using ESP8266 with HDC1008 and Adafruit IO

This code was modified to work with an Adafruit HDC1008 breakout board instead of a DHT11 or DHT22.  It was also modified to pull the voltage for uses with a Lipo battery.

I want to add deep sleep function to this as well.
